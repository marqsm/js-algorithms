=============

Implementing classical algorithms and datastructures in Javascript.

Based very strongly on the coursera courses "Algorithms I" and "Algorithms II" by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne as well as their book "Algorithms".

Any mistakes in implementations are by me (or other contributors).
